 Netflix clone :
 As a Front-End Developer, I created a Netflix clone using HTML and CSS to design and implement the user
 interface. The project involved crafting a responsive and visually appealing front-end that mimics the look and
 feel of the Netflix platform.
 * I focused on building intuitive navigation, movie browsing, and a user-friendly layout.This project allowed me
 to enhance my skills in HTML, CSS and demonstrate my ability to functional, and visually appealing web pages.
